  <h1>Why More New Yorkers Are Gambling Their Biggest Asset on the Next Hurricane</h1>
    <h3>Where it rains, it can flood, but uninsured New Yorkers either don’t know they need flood insurance or don’t think the price is worth it.</h3>

<div class="container">

<p>Storms have become an increasingly common and expected source of flooding and property damage for New Yorkers, but many of the affected neighborhoods aren’t the coastal communities that typically bear the brunt of extreme rainfall. </p>

<p>When Emily Baldwin was planning to buy a new home in 2021, she looked to her childhood hometown of Rye in Westchester, New York. While parts of Westchester do have a history of flooding, she and her parents — who advised her to stay away from certain neighborhoods that were known for flooding — knew the area well enough to feel confident purchasing a house in Glen Oaks built in the 1920s near Beaver Swamp Brook. </p>

<p>But when Hurricane Ida hit New York 6 months later, Baldwin’s home only narrowly escaped being submerged by the sheer amount of rain that made the brook overflow and caused water to back up through a sink in her own basement.</p>

<p>Her neighbors weren’t so lucky, though. Those who lived closer to the brook had water reach the first floor of their houses, and others further up the block that sat at a higher elevation still experienced several feet of flooding in their basements and subground garages.</p>

<p>Now, she, her husband and the rest of their neighbors seem to constantly worry about their houses when they know a storm’s coming.</p>

<p>“Everyone talks in inches of rain and the rate of rain — everyone's like a baby meteorologist here,” she said. “... it's something that's on everyone's mind at all times.”</p>

<p>As climate change continues to increase the frequency and intensity of storms like Hurricane Ida, more New Yorkers across the state are learning that their homes are more vulnerable to flooding than previously thought — including those in areas that were never considered to be flood prone.</p>

<p>Despite this, fewer homeowners who are eligible for flood insurance are signing up for or keeping their policies.</p>

<p>Part of why fewer people are opting to sign up for flood insurance has to do with how they find out about their property’s risk of flooding in the first place, said John Aloysius Zinda, a professor and researcher at Cornell University who studies how communities affected by flooding confront flood risk.</p>

<p>“So it actually often goes the opposite way from what you'd expect,” Zinda said. Typically, someone would learn about a risk, evaluate the potential costs of the risk, figure out how likely it is to happen, and then decide whether to take an action against it. However, many buyers tend to find out about their house’s flood risk after they buy their house and later learn they might need flood insurance once they’re locked in.</p>

<p>Zinda, who surveyed and spoke to homeowners in the Hudson Valley about their perception of flood risk in 2020 as part of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2025.105472">ongoing research</a>, said a lot of them didn't find out about their area’s flood risk until after they bought their house with a mortgage in the flood zone. Congress requires financial lenders to require flood insurance for properties with federally-backed loans, making flood insurance a requirement to secure a mortgage to buy a new house in federally-designated flood zones with an annual 1% chance of flooding.</p>

<p>“So that 1% line, even though it's based on a sort of arbitrary decision made in the 70s, has become arguably the key instrument through which people learn about flood risk,” he said. “But that means people who live outside that line, or people who don't get a mortgage, or people who are entrepreneurs, often don't find out about that.”</p>

<p>FEMA largely determines flood risk based on its own historical data from past coastal and river flooding events. It also takes into account historical flooding from rainfall, but it doesn’t actively take into account other environmental data that impacts climate change-induced flooding, like sea level rise. Despite legislation, FEMA’s flood maps also don’t get updated as often as they should, due to the amount of time, money and effort it takes to accurately map an area.</p>

<p>The combination of inaccurate flood maps and consumer ignorance is a problem because NFIP insurance claims are increasingly coming from areas considered “low risk” of flooding. Data shows that even low-risk flood zones are still vulnerable to flooding. An <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/flood-insurance-policies-study">analysis</a> of NFIP data from November 2023 to 2024 by ValuePenguin, a personal finance research and analysis website, found that 41.4% of active NFIP policies in New York that year were outside high-risk flood zones. 39.7% of NFIP claims in the state were also outside high-risk flood zones.</p>

<p>Risk is an important factor in pricing flood insurance. In the past, homeowners living inside the 1% line would typically pay a lot for flood insurance and those living outside the line paid much less, regardless of their actual current flood risk.</p>

<p>Ever since FEMA updated its insurance rating methodology with a new system called Risk Rating 2.0 in 2022, many policyholders who happened to be overpaying for flood insurance based on the old system benefited from their premiums going down. In New York, 28% of single family home policyholders saw their premiums immediately decrease in the first year it was implemented, according to FEMA data.</p>

<p>However, many others have seen the cost of their premiums increase. Even though NFIP premiums can only increase 18% per year at most, 60% are seeing the price of their policies increase up to $120 per year, and 12% are seeing it rise up to $240 per year or more.</p>

<div style="min-height:400px" id="datawrapper-vis-fYoOZ"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fYoOZ/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-fYoOZ"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fYoOZ/full.png" alt="" /></noscript></div>

<p>New York is a state which already has high flood insurance and housing costs relative to other parts of the country. The average annual NFIP premium in New York in 2024 was $1,133, compared to about $900 nationwide, according to an analysis by <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/flood-insurance-cost">NerdWallet</a>. And while the NFIP only insures a maximum of $250,000, the residential median <a href="https://www.tax.ny.gov/research/property/assess/sales/stmedprice.htm">sale price</a> in New York in 2024 was $331,500 according to the state Department of Taxation and Finance.</p>

<p>“This might be ok in some places, but it’s not ok in states like New York and Jersey where houses are insanely expensive to rebuild,” said Divya Sangameshwar, an insurance expert and analyst at ValuePenguin who was involved in the organization’s 2025 NFIP report.</p>

<p>Those paying off mortgages in federal flood zones can’t drop their policies regardless of how much their premiums cost since they’re legally required to be insured, and most private insurers back away from insuring properties in such high-risk areas because it’s not profitable. However, the combination of New York’s established history of flooding driving up premiums, and high-value homes that are expensive to rebuild after a storm make the added expense of flood insurance a tough sell for people who don’t think they’ll need it or get enough value from it.</p>

<p>“We're not necessarily even talking about very low income families,” said Amber Silver at SUNY Albany, who researches how people make decisions before, during and after high-impact weather.</p>

<p>“Price can be prohibitive for many people, and so some people might get sticker shock realizing, ‘Wow, you're telling me that I have to pay $2,500, or $800, or whatever the amount is for flood insurance when I know that I'm in a 1-in-500-year floodplain — why would I pay for something that's never going to happen?’” Silver said. “Trying to get around that cognitive disconnect can be tough.”</p>

<p>On the other side of Beaver Swamp Brook, Patrick Truit, his wife and their 10-day-old newborn experienced about an inch of flooding in their Harrison home’s basement when Hurricane Ida hit. Like Baldwin, his neighbors experienced much more significant flooding than he did, with basements full of water and backyards he said looked like swimming pools.</p>

<p>However, he doesn’t think flood insurance makes sense for him given the small amount of water he typically deals with when it rains and the fact that his house sits at a higher elevation than most in his neighborhood.</p>

<p>“From my understanding I think it's fairly expensive, so if we're not required to to get it — and unless I felt like we would have a catastrophic loss — I don't think I would do that,” he said.</p>

<p>Instead, he’s opted to waterproof his basement and install french drains and a sump pump system for a total cost of about $7,500 — less expensive than the value he thinks he’d get from paying a flood insurance premium in his situation.</p>

<p>The cost of flood insurance for policyholders has been a hot bipartisan issue for a while, and various politicians from around the country have proposed policy changes to make the program more affordable for consumers since the the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012.</p>

<p>Here in New York, Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-NY-02) and Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ-05) recently proposed the <a href="https://garbarino.house.gov/media/press-releases/garbarino-gottheimer-introduce-bipartisan-float-act-reduce-financial-burden">FLOAT Act</a> in October 2024. While the bill hasn’t passed, it aims to offer $1,000 annually to households making under $200,000 to offset the cost of flood insurance premiums, whether through the NFIP or private insurers.</p>

<p>"Long Islanders know firsthand the impact of flooding and the importance of being prepared. This legislation provides a critical incentive for homeowners to protect their properties without breaking the bank,” Garbarino said in a press release.</p>

<p>However, some consumer advocates don’t think financial incentives like this one are the answer to the problem of flood insurance uptake and retention.</p>

<p>“I would rather see the premiums come down through risk reduction and better structured insurance cooling that isn't so heavily reliant on unregulated private [insurance],” said Amy Bach, co-founder of the nonprofit United Policyholders. NFIP policies take 30 days to come into effect from the date of purchase — meaning that if a storm were to hit and flood a new policyholder’s home before the end of those 30 days, the NFIP won’t cover that. It’s a deterrent for many on the edge of buying a policy as hurricane season approaches.</p>

<p>For now, the only way to get coverage that comes into effect sooner is to purchase a policy from a private insurance company — a solution Bach isn’t a fan of either due to their profit-driven motives, especially if taxpayer-funded subsidies were to be involved.</p>

<p>Plenty of people might be hesitant to commit their own money to buying a policy they may or may not need based on what flood zone they’re in, but experts say they give many consumers a false sense of security. Changes to a neighborhood’s infrastructure, for example, can leave homeowners blindsided to increases in long-term flood risk, Silver suggested.</p>

<p>“I hate to break it to you, if you are seeing a lot more construction, if there's a lot more building, if there's a lot less green space than there was in your community 25 years ago, then those numbers are not accurate anymore,” Silver said.</p>

<p>Long-standing flood zone classifications don’t take into account the fast changes in the natural environment that come with land development, like the removal of trees and soil that naturally absorb water and help mitigate flooding. These happen much more quickly than FEMA’s flood maps can keep up with.</p>

<p>This is why developers, planners and local governments need to adapt and prepare for future flood risk in the context of what the future climate will look like rather than the conditions of the past, said Kevin Reed, a climate scientist at Stony Brook University. Heavier rainfall is one of the most telltale signs of climate change, and New York has seen a significant increase in its amount of annual rainfall over the last century. It’s only <a href="https://nysclimateimpacts.org/explore-the-assessment/new-york-states-changing-climate/nysc-precipitation/#:~:text=Historical%20observations:%20From,Hudson%20River%20Valley.">projected to increase</a>  with time, affecting New York City, the Catskills and the lower Hudson River Valley the most.</p>

<p>It’s especially important when it comes to the future of New York City’s aging infrastructure, which already struggles to handle water during normal rain levels and gets overwhelmed by extreme storms that produce two to four inches of rain per hour like Hurricane Ida and Hurricane Sandy. The NYC Department of Environmental Protection’s <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/dep/downloads/pdf/water/stormwater/2024-stormwater-analysis-report.pdf">2024 stormwater analysis</a> identified more than 100 non-coastal parts of the city that experience chronic stormwater flooding and sewer back-ups, flooding streets, houses and residential buildings.</p>

<p>Sewage and stormwater management and rainfall levels vary between cities and towns across the state. While Reed thinks it’s unlikely that a hurricane of the same magnitude as Ida will be just as damaging to inland parts of the state as Ida was, he emphasized the importance of preparation since storms are so common in the region.</p>

<p>“Almost every few years, there's always a storm that's either threatening to make landfall, or comes close to or does,” Reed said. “I don't have a percentage per se, but we should always be planning for these types of storms every hurricane season.”</p>

<p>Officials and experts promote flood insurance as the best way to prepare, but even those who do have flood insurance have to spend time filing a claim, waiting for it to be approved, and living with water damage from flooding unless they have enough resources to immediately start repairs or relocate in the meantime.</p>

<p>Like Truit, Baldwin’s not sure she’d benefit enough from flood insurance to justify the cost. But what she and her neighbors experienced during Hurricane Ida fostered a strong community that’s now an essential part of storm preparation in their neighborhood. She’s since managed to organize a WhatsApp group that now has about 120 women in it from households across Glen Oaks. Even though anxiety still spikes among them when they know a storm’s on its way, they’ve learned to lean on each other for help and support dealing with rain and flooding.</p>

<p>Balwin recalled that when one woman couldn’t get in touch with a local plumbing and water cleanup company when Tropical Storm Ophelia flooded her basement in 2023, she reached out to the group chat to ask for spare wet vacuums and dehumidifiers. She ended up with about 10 wet vacuums and seven dehumidifiers, and too few outlets to plug them all into.</p>

<p>“Anyone that had these items and didn't have to actively manage the situation was just delivering them to her house, you know,” Baldwin said.</p>

<p>“It’s just a nice thing that now we have this community — that when people need to pull together to get through a flooding situation, we have it,” she said. “So, it’s like a silver lining.”</p>
